This was our final weekend as non-parents. We mostly conducted ourselves as normal, except that we went to a restaurant that was fairly schmance, just because we might not be able to do that again for a while, even though we're not normal consumers of schmance.

I felt the urge to code a lot because I have heard much of the interruptive power of babies, but A) I should be engaging with my pregnant wife and also life B) furious, desperate coding rarely amounts to much. So, instead we went outside a lot, and one of those times, we went out to Menotomy Rocks.

Here is one of the rocks. I guess it's of the Menotomy sort. It was large, and I was impressed.

Oh, nature. Much articulation/reticulation wow

The Menotomy Rocks park is not that big, and a lot of people live right next to it. I just thought it must be fairly ballin' perk to live near an urban center, yet have a forest as your backyard.

Another rock, this one mossier. It reminded me of the Hulk.

It's probably the very non-woodsy nature of my upbringing, but scenes like this remind me of <a href="http://www.agamesroom.com/library/images/screenshots/qfg1/qfg1ss4.gif">Hero's</a> <a href="http://www.mobygames.com/game/dos/heros-quest-so-you-want-to-be-a-hero/screenshots">Quest</a>.

I thought this pond did some real good work with reflecting.

Speaking of which, it feels like we're about to move to another home or something.

Also, despite:

- Taking childbirth classes
- Assembling a crib and making space
- Reading up on safe living conditions for children and wrangling for them
- Searching for childcare
- Pretty much centering the last nine months on the arrival of our son
- Hearing about how hard the sacrifices are
- It being morning of the day of labor induction

I don't really comprehend what it's going to be like. I want to see this guy and help him develop, but I don't really feel the fear I should be. Fortunately, this frog-before-the-boiling attitude toward big events keeps me from useless worry, so, eh.

Well, it's been good being a non-child-having guy, but now I will see how it is being a child-having guy!
