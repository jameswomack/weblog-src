  Here's some stuff we saw while walking around North Cambridge and thereabouts Sunday morning.

  Something I really like about this neighborhood is that seems to have no one telling you your house has to be beige or whatever. You can paint your house however you like. It seems unlikely we'll be able to afford to own in this area, but if we do, I want the house to be nice and saturated like this powerful yellow one.

  In a similar vein, I like that you can basically have a meadow by your house (presumably) without complaints about dandelions.

  Katt (contemplating the tree above) says this is some variant of dogwood, except with wide, flat petals. They almost form a plane. I am into that.

  There's these lofts that you can see from the Alewife Linear Park/Minuteman Bikeway that we call "Expensive Lofts." I think the development is actually called either Tannery Brook Row or Davis Lofts. (A friend of ours told us pointed out that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanning">tanneries</a> are actually fairly toxic, so it's like this place is actually built on some poison burial grounds. If you don't eat plants grown in the soil, you're probably fine, though.)

  We checked out the other side of it today, and it's kinda nifty. There's little ponds and gardens. This picture has some really out-of-control exposure, but some of the passages look like some kinda wooded elf town.

  There's the ruins of a small house. In front, there are the matching ruins of a driveway. Perhaps there was some contention between that house and its bigger neighbor; small house lost. The big house razed the small house to its foundations, leaving just a bit standing as a monument to its power.

  <a class="img-container" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/14134529817/in/set-72157644546343690"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2926/14134529817_9b62be418b_c.jpg" alt="Sunday moseying"></a>

  I liked this secret porch set up. You can enjoy the outside while not being obvious to passersby. Wearing the proper camo, you could possibly even be invisible.

  <a class="img-container" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/14317713991/in/set-72157644546343690"><img src="https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2930/14317713991_e49c74cc95_c.jpg" alt="Sunday moseying"></a>

  This was a pretty cool contrail.

  A tree with a chunk missing by Davis Station. Was this tree struck by lightning? I thought it may have been <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/8674311065/">this tree</a>, but that was a different one, blown over by the wind.

  <a class="img-container" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ignignokt/14134386578/in/set-72157644546343690"><img src="https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5315/14134386578_1edd0bd69c_c.jpg" alt="Sunday moseying"></a>

  Things were very dappled today. So much dappling!

BTW, if you also have a static html blog like this one and a Flickr account and want to put together a photo post with them, you may find it can be kind of annoying to get all the picture links you want out of a photo set. So, I wrote [flickrset-to-html](https://github.com/jimkang/flickrset-to-html) to do that for me, then just posted the resulting html into this post.
